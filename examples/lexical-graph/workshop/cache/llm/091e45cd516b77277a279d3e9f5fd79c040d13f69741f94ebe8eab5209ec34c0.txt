Neptune Serverless Instance Type Information

The serverless instance type is a Neptune Serverless feature.
Neptune Serverless is a feature that can scale instance size dynamically based on a workload's resource needs.
Neptune Serverless lets users set lower and upper limits on compute capacity for the instances in their DB cluster.
Compute capacity in Neptune Serverless is measured in Neptune Capacity Units.
Neptune Serverless eliminates the need to calculate how many vCPUs are needed for an application.
Workloads with varying utilization can be cost-optimized by using serverless rather than provisioned instances.
Users can set up both provisioned and serverless instances in the same DB cluster.
Setting up both provisioned and serverless instances in the same DB cluster can achieve an optimal cost-performance configuration.
