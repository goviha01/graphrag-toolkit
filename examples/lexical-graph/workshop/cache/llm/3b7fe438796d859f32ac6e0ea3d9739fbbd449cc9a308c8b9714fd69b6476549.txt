r7i Instance Family Features and Architecture

The r7i family is a family of instance types.
The r7i family is powered by 4th-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors.
4th-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors are code named Sapphire Rapids.
The r7i family offers significant improvements over r6i instances.
The r7i instances provide approximately 15% better compute price/performance than comparable r6i instance types.
The r7i instances provide up to 20% higher memory bandwidth per vCPU than comparable r6i instance types.
The r7i instance family has a 2-socket Intel CPU architecture.
The r7i instance family architecture is similar to the r5 family.
The r7i.12xlarge is an instance type in the r7i family.
The r7i.12xlarge and smaller types use a single socket.
The r7i.12xlarge and smaller types use the system memory owned by that single-socket processor.
The r7i.16xlarge is an instance type in the r7i family.
The r7i.24xlarge is an instance type in the r7i family.
The r7i.16xlarge and r7i.24xlarge types use both sockets and available memory.
There is some memory-management overhead required between two physical processors in a 2-socket architecture.
The performance gains scaling up from a r7i.12xlarge to a r7i.16xlarge or r7i.24xlarge instance type are not as linear as scaling up at the smaller sizes.
The r7i family is powered by 4th-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors.
Performance scales linearly with compute capacity up to r7i.12xlarge in the r7i family.
The r7i family has enhanced memory management between physical processors in the 2-socket architecture.
The r7i family has improved performance for memory-intensive graph operations.
The number of vCPUs needed can be estimated using the formula vCPUs=(latencyxconcurrency)/2.
In the vCPU estimation formula, latency is measured as the average query latency in seconds.
In the vCPU estimation formula, concurrency is measured as the target number of queries per second.
