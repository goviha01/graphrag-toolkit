r6g family instance types and Graviton2 processor characteristics

The r6g family is a family of instance types.
AWS has developed its own ARM-based processor called Graviton.
Graviton is an ARM-based processor.
AWS developed Graviton.
Graviton delivers better price/performance than the Intel and AMD equivalents.
The r6g family uses the Graviton2 processor.
Graviton2 is a processor.
The Graviton2 processor offers 10-20% better performance for OLTP-style (constrained) graph queries.
OLTP-style queries are constrained graph queries.
Larger, OLAP-ish queries may be slightly less performant with the Graviton2 processors than with Intel ones.
The slightly less performant performance of larger, OLAP-ish queries with Graviton2 processors is owing to slightly less performant memory-paging performance.
Intel processors have slightly more performant memory-paging performance than Graviton2 processors.
The r6g family has a single-socket architecture.
Performance scales linearly with compute capacity from an r6g.large to an r6g.16xlarge in the r6g family.
r6g.large is an instance type in the r6g family.
r6g.16xlarge is an instance type in the r6g family.
r6g.16xlarge is the largest type in the r6g family.
