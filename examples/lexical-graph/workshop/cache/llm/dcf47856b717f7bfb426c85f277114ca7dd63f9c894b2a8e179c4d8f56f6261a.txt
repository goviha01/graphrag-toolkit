  proposition: The r6g family is a family of instance types.
    
    entity-entity relationships:
    
    entity-attributes:
    r6g family|IS_A|family of instance types
      
  proposition: AWS has developed its own ARM-based processor called Graviton.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    AWS|DEVELOPED|Graviton
  
    entity-attributes:
    Graviton|DESCRIBED_BY|ARM-based processor

  proposition: Graviton is an ARM-based processor.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    Graviton|IS_A|ARM-based processor

  proposition: AWS developed Graviton.
  
    entity-entity relationships:

    entity-attributes:

  proposition: Graviton delivers better price/performance than the Intel and AMD equivalents.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    Graviton|HAS_PERFORMANCE|better price/performance than the Intel and AMD equivalents

  proposition: The r6g family uses the Graviton2 processor.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r6g family|USES|Graviton2
  
    entity-attributes:

  proposition: Graviton2 is a processor.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    Graviton2|IS_A|processor

  proposition: The Graviton2 processor offers 10-20% better performance for OLTP-style (constrained) graph queries.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    Graviton2|HAS_PERFORMANCE|10-20% better performance for OLTP-style (constrained) graph queries

  proposition: OLTP-style queries are constrained graph queries.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:

  proposition: Larger, OLAP-ish queries may be slightly less performant with the Graviton2 processors than with Intel ones.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    Graviton2|HAS_PERFORMANCE|slightly less performant for larger, OLAP-ish queries than Intel

  proposition: The slightly less performant performance of larger, OLAP-ish queries with Graviton2 processors is owing to slightly less performant memory-paging performance.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    Graviton2|HAS_PERFORMANCE|slightly less performant memory-paging performance

  proposition: Intel processors have slightly more performant memory-paging performance than Graviton2 processors.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    Intel|HAS_PERFORMANCE|slightly more performant memory-paging performance than Graviton2

  proposition: The r6g family has a single-socket architecture.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    r6g family|HAS_ARCHITECTURE|single-socket architecture

  proposition: Performance scales linearly with compute capacity from an r6g.large to an r6g.16xlarge in the r6g family.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r6g.large|PART_OF|r6g family
    r6g.16xlarge|PART_OF|r6g family
  
    entity-attributes:
    r6g family|HAS_PERFORMANCE|scales linearly with compute capacity from r6g.large to r6g.16xlarge
