r7g Instance Type Family Features and Performance

The r7g family is a family of instance types.
The r7g family uses the AWS Graviton3 processor.
The AWS Graviton3 processor delivers better price/performance than previous Graviton2-based instances.
The Graviton3 processor offers 25-30% better performance for OLTP-style graph queries compared to r6g instances.
The r7g family has a single-socket architecture.
The single-socket architecture means that performance scales linearly with compute capacity from an r7g.large to an r7g.16xlarge.
The r7g.16xlarge is the largest type in the r7g family.
The r7g family is powered by AWS Graviton3 ARM-based processors.
The r7g family has improved memory-paging performance compared to r6g.
The improved memory-paging performance benefits both OLTP and OLAP workloads.
The r7g family has enhanced buffer-pool cache efficiency.
The r7g family has lower latency for memory-intensive operations.
The r7g family is well-suited for production environments with varied query patterns.
The r7g family is particularly effective for workloads that benefit from improved memory bandwidth.
