r5d Instance Types and Neptune Lookup Cache Feature

Neptune is a service.
Neptune has a lookup-cache feature.
The lookup-cache feature can be used to improve the performance of queries which need to fetch and return large numbers of property values and literals.
The lookup-cache feature is used primarily by customers with queries that need to return many attributes.
The lookup cache boosts performance of these queries by fetching these attribute values locally rather than looking up each one over and over in Neptune indexed storage.
The lookup cache is implemented using a NVMe-attached EBS volume on an r5d instance type.
The lookup cache is enabled using a cluster's parameter group.
As data is fetched from Neptune indexed storage, property values and RDF literals are cached within this NVMe volume.
r5d is a family of instance types.
r5 is a family of instance types.
If you don't need the lookup cache feature, use a standard r5 instance type rather than an r5d, to avoid the higher cost of the r5d.
The r5d family has instance types in the same sizes as the r5 family.
The r5d family ranges from r5d.large to r5d.24xlarge.
r5d.large is an instance type in the r5d family.
r5d.24xlarge is an instance type in the r5d family.
