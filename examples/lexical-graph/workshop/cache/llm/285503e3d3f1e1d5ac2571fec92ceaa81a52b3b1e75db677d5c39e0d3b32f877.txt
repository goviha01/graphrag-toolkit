  proposition: Neptune is a service.
    
    entity-entity relationships:
    
    entity-attributes:
    Neptune|IS_A|service
      
  proposition: Neptune has a lookup-cache feature.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    Neptune|HAS|lookup-cache feature
  
    entity-attributes:
    
  proposition: The lookup-cache feature can be used to improve the performance of queries which need to fetch and return large numbers of property values and literals.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    lookup-cache feature|IMPROVES|property values
    lookup-cache feature|IMPROVES|RDF literals
  
    entity-attributes:
    lookup-cache feature|PURPOSE|improve the performance of queries which need to fetch and return large numbers of property values and literals
    
  proposition: The lookup-cache feature is used primarily by customers with queries that need to return many attributes.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    lookup-cache feature|USED_BY|customers with queries that need to return many attributes
    
  proposition: The lookup cache boosts performance of these queries by fetching these attribute values locally rather than looking up each one over and over in Neptune indexed storage.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    lookup cache|FETCHES_FROM|Neptune indexed storage
  
    entity-attributes:
    lookup cache|FUNCTION|boosts performance of these queries by fetching these attribute values locally rather than looking up each one over and over in Neptune indexed storage
    
  proposition: The lookup cache is implemented using a NVMe-attached EBS volume on an r5d instance type.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    lookup cache|IMPLEMENTED_USING|NVMe-attached EBS volume
    NVMe-attached EBS volume|RUNS_ON|r5d instance type
  
    entity-attributes:
    
  proposition: The lookup cache is enabled using a cluster's parameter group.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    lookup cache|ENABLED_BY|cluster's parameter group
  
    entity-attributes:
    
  proposition: As data is fetched from Neptune indexed storage, property values and RDF literals are cached within this NVMe volume.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    property values|CACHED_IN|NVMe volume
    RDF literals|CACHED_IN|NVMe volume

  proposition: r5d is a family of instance types.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    r5d|IS_A|family of instance types
    
  proposition: r5 is a family of instance types.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    r5|IS_A|family of instance types
    
  proposition: If you don't need the lookup cache feature, use a standard r5 instance type rather than an r5d, to avoid the higher cost of the r5d.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r5|ALTERNATIVE_TO|r5d
  
    entity-attributes:
    r5|DESCRIBED_AS|standard
    r5d|HAS_COST|higher cost
    
  proposition: The r5d family has instance types in the same sizes as the r5 family.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r5d family|SAME_SIZES_AS|r5 family
  
    entity-attributes:
    
  proposition: The r5d family ranges from r5d.large to r5d.24xlarge.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r5d.large|PART_OF|r5d family
    r5d.24xlarge|PART_OF|r5d family
  
    entity-attributes:
    r5d family|RANGES_FROM|r5d.large to r5d.24xlarge
    
  proposition: r5d.large is an instance type in the r5d family.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r5d.large|MEMBER_OF|r5d family
  
    entity-attributes:
    r5d.large|IS_A|instance type
    
  proposition: r5d.24xlarge is an instance type in the r5d family.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r5d.24xlarge|MEMBER_OF|r5d family
