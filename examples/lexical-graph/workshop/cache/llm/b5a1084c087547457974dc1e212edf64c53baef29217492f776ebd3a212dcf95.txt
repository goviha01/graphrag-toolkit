r8g Family Instance Types Features and Capabilities

The r8g family is a family of instance types.
The r8g family contains memory-optimized instance types.
The r8g family instance types are powered by AWS Graviton4 processors.
AWS Graviton4 processors are ARM-based processors.
The r8g family instances offer significant performance improvements over previous generations.
The r8g family instances are well-suited for memory-intensive graph workloads.
The r8g instances provide approximately 15-20% better performance for graph queries compared to r7g instances.
The r8g family has a single-socket architecture.
The r8g family single-socket architecture means that performance scales linearly with compute capacity from an r8g.large to an r8g.16xlarge.
The r8g.16xlarge is the largest type in the r8g family.
The r8g family is powered by AWS Graviton4 ARM-based processors.
The r8g family has higher memory bandwidth per vCPU compared to previous generations.
The r8g family has excellent price/performance ratio for both OLTP-style (constrained) graph queries and OLAP-style analytical workloads.
The r8g family has improved memory management capabilities that benefit complex graph traversals.
The r8g family is ideal for production workloads that require high memory capacity and consistent performance.
The r8g family is particularly effective for applications with high query concurrency requirements.
