  proposition: The AWS Graviton3 processor delivers better price/performance than previous Graviton2-based instances.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
  
    entity-attributes:
    AWS Graviton3 processor|HAS_PERFORMANCE|better price/performance than previous Graviton2-based instances
    
  proposition: The Graviton3 processor offers 25-30% better performance for OLTP-style graph queries compared to r6g instances.

    entity-attributes:
    Graviton3 processor|HAS_PERFORMANCE|25-30% better performance for OLTP-style graph queries compared to r6g instances
    
  proposition: The r7g family has a single-socket architecture.
  
    entity-entity relationships:
    r7g family|HAS|single-socket architecture
  
    entity-attributes:
    
  proposition: The single-socket architecture means that performance scales linearly with compute capacity from an r7g.large to an r7g.16xlarge.
