r5 Family Instance Types Specifications and Performance Characteristics

The r5 family is a family of instance types.
The r5 family contains memory-optimized instance types.
The r5 family memory-optimized instance types work well for most graph use cases.
The r5 family contains instance types from r5.large up to r5.24xlarge.
The r5 family instance types scale linearly in compute performance as you increase in size.
r5.large is an instance type.
r5.large has 2 vCPUs and 16GiB of memory.
r5.xlarge is an instance type.
r5.xlarge has 4 vCPUs and 32GiB of memory.
r5.xlarge has twice the vCPUs and memory of r5.large.
r5.2xlarge is an instance type.
r5.2xlarge has 8 vCPUs and 64GiB of memory.
r5.2xlarge has twice the vCPUs and memory of r5.xlarge.
Query performance scales directly with compute capacity up to the r5.12xlarge instance type.
r5.12xlarge is an instance type.
The r5 instance family has a 2-socket Intel CPU architecture.
r5.12xlarge and smaller types use a single socket.
r5.12xlarge and smaller types use the system memory owned by that single-socket processor.
r5.16xlarge is an instance type.
r5.24xlarge is an instance type.
r5.16xlarge and r5.24xlarge types use both sockets and available memory.
There is some memory-management overhead required between two physical processors in a 2-socket architecture.
The performance gains scaling up from r5.12xlarge to r5.16xlarge or r5.24xlarge instance type are not as linear as you get scaling up at the smaller sizes.
