    "## What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will learn how to create domain-specific tools that can be used by an AI agent to address more complex information goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GraphRAG Tool automatically creates domain-specific tools that can be consumed via the Model Context Protocol (see below). The ability to create domain-specific tools depends on two other features of the toolkit, introduced in previous exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Multi-tenancy:** The ability to host multiple separate lexical graphs within the same underlying graph and vector stores. This capability allows you to manage and query different sets of data within a shared infrastructure.\n",
    " - **Inferred schemas:** When indexing data, the GraphRAG Toolkit creates schema nodes that represent the implicit domain sematics at the entity-relationship tier of the lexical graph.\n",
    " \n",
    "This exercise use two datasets, which have already been pre-built for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - An aircraft information dataset sourced from Wikipedia\n",
    "  - An aviation accident dataset courtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\n",
    "  \n",
    "In the course of this exercise you will:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Review the inferred schemas for each of these two tenant graphs\n",
    "  - Create an MCP server that automatically creates tools for these tenant graphs\n",
    "  - Create an MCP client\n",
    "  - Review the tool descriptions generated by the toolkit\n",
    "  - Create an agent that orchestrates multiple question-answering interactions to help answer complex questions\n",
    "  - Review the interactions between the agent and the tools\n",

    "## MCP Tooling\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.\n",

    "In this example, you are going to create a 'catalog' of tools, one per tenant in a multi-tenant graph. Each tool is capable of answering domain-specific questions based on the data in its tenant graph. This catalog will be advertised to clients via an MCP server. Clients (typically agents and LLMs) can then browse the catalog and choose appropriate tools for addressing their information goals.\n",
    "\n",
