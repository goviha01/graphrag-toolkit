    "\n",
    "In the course of this exercise you will:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Inspect the document to be indexed\n",
    "  - Load and extract the data to disk\n",
    "  - Inspect the extracted chunks\n",
    "  - Build the graph and vector index from the extracted data\n",
    "  - Learn about the hierarchical lexical graph model\n",

    "\n",
    "Loads and chunks documents, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform two extraction steps: proposition extraction, which converts chunked text into well-formed statements, and topic/entity/fact extraction, which identifies relations and concepts.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - You can run the Extract and Build pipelines together for continuous ingest.\n",
    "  - You can run the Extract and Build stages separately, for more controlled processing.\n",

    "Chunking splits a large text into smaller chunks using a [LlamaIndex splitter](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules/#text-splitters), such as `MarkdownNodeParser` or `SentenceSplitter`.
