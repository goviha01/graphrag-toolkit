## Aircraft:
Cessna 172K

## Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground

## Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal

## Accident Number:
CEN14CA096

## Registration:
N1176M

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Injuries:
2 Minor, 2 None

## Analysis

The pilot reported that while approaching to land the airplane floated and he had to push forward on the control yoke to finish the descent. He stated that this used about 200 feet of runway. He said that the landing was normal, but after touchdown the braking effectiveness on the grass runway was such that the airplane was not slowing as expected. The pilot elected to turn off of the runway into a farm field adjacent the runway. He said that hidden in the tall grass along the runway was a 18 to 20 inch ridge. The airplane struck the ridge severing the nose landing gear and nosing over. The pilot reported no pre-impact mechanical difficulties.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath during approach which resulted in the airplane landing long, and his decision to turn off of the runway during the landing roll which resulted in a collision with an earth berm.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=88615](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=88615)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](here).
