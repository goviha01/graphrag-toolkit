## Accident Number:
WPR13CA162

## Registration:
N47964

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Injuries:
2 None

## Analysis

The pilot reported that as the tailwheel-equipped airplane decelerated after touchdown, it tracked left of the runway centerline. He applied corrective control inputs; however, the airplane continued to track left and departed the runway. The right wing contacted the ground and was substantially damaged during the runway excursion. The pilot reported that during the recently completed 100-hour annual inspection, the tailwheel suspension strut was modified with a different type of strut and that the new strut did not compress on landing until after right rudder was applied. However, review of the tailwheel strut design revealed that the strut only affects the vertical movement of the tailwheel, and has no lateral control effects. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of a mechanical failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86502](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86502)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86502).
