## Analysis

The pilot reported that, upon receiving clearance to taxi from air traffic control, he proceeded to taxi onto what he thought was the centerline of the taxiway in nighttime conditions. During the taxi, the airplane suddenly turned right. The pilot stopped the airplane and thought something on the ground had made "the wheel turn." He looked at the right wing but noticed nothing abnormal. After the airplane was airborne, the pilot saw that part of the right wingtip was separated. The pilot continued the flight and landed uneventfully at his destination. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right wing had sustained substantive structural damage. A portion of the airplane's right wingtip was found underneath a damaged wing on an unoccupied airplane that was parked adjacent to the taxiway. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a parked airplane during taxi operations at night.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100908](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100908)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100908).
