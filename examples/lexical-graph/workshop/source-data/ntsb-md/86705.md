# Aviation Investigation Final Report

## Location:
Grand Canyon, Arizona

## Date & Time: 
April 23, 2013, 14:45 Local

## Aircraft:
BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON 206L-1

## Defining Event:
Tailstrike

## Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional

## Accident Number:
WPR13CA206

## Registration:
N2072M

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Injuries:
2 None

## Analysis
The flight instructor reported that she and the pilot receiving instruction were practicing autorotations. During an autorotation involving a right 180-degree turn, the flight instructor announced that the throttle was coming on, and then announced when full throttle was on. The pilot then started to level the helicopter. Because the wind had shifted to a tailwind during the maneuver, the pilot was forced to flare harder and use more cyclic control than expected. The flight instructor realized that completing a power recovery from the autorotation was going to result in an overtorque condition, took over control, and landed the helicopter. During the landing, the tailboom was substantially damaged. The flight instructor reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:The failure of the flight instructor and the pilot receiving instruction to recognize before entering the flare that the wind had shifted to a tailwind and terminate the practice autorotation.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86705](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86705)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86705).
