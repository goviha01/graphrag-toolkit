## Aircraft:
AMERICAN GENERAL ACFT CORP AG5B

## Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj (CFIT)

## Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal

## Accident Number:
CEN13CA133

## Registration:
N897GA

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Injuries:
1 None

## Analysis

The pilot stated that before arriving at his destination airport in night visual meteorological conditions, he listened to the automated weather observing system, which indicated wind from 220 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 26 knots. The pilot aborted his first attempt to land after a bounced landing. During the second approach to land, the pilot observed the visual approach slope indicator rapidly transition from both white (indicating high on the glideslope) to both red (indicating low on the glideslope) and decided to perform a go-around. During the attempted go-around, the airplane's left wing struck a tree, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing and horizontal stabilizer. The pilot then landed the airplane without further incident on his third landing attempt. The pilot stated that the airplane's interior lighting was too bright for the night conditions and that the bright runway lights in the dark rural setting gave him a "false sense of night vision."

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glide path to the runway in gusty wind conditions and his failure to maintain clearance from obstructions during the subsequent go-around. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's improper interior lighting configuration.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86020](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86020)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://here).
