## Analysis

The pilot reported that he decided to land at an en route airport to obtain fuel due to a stronger headwind than what was forecast for his route of flight. The pilot made a normal landing to the north and turned west off the runway onto the first taxi. He then made another turn to the north on the taxiway that paralleled the runway. As he taxied beyond a row of trees that were to the west, the upwind wing of the airplane lifted and the airplane flipped inverted. The rudder and left front wing strut were substantially damaged. The pilot stated he was using proper crosswind taxi technique, but was unable to keep the wing down. The wind conditions recorded at an airport located 37 miles away from the airport where the accident occurred were from 290 degrees at 16 knots gusting to 25 knots. The pilot reported the local wind condition at the time of the accident was similar.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's inability to control the airplane while taxiing due to a strong crosswind condition.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=89179](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=89179)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=89179).
