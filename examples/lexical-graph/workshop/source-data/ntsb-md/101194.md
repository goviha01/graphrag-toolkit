## Analysis

The pilot practiced taxiing the airplane for about 1/2 hour before he attempted a takeoff and landing. After landing, he decided to practice a runway "speed up and down" to become more comfortable with engine settings. During the first "runup," he applied "very light throttle input," but the engine power increased "very fast." The airplane suddenly turned left, and the left wing dropped close to the ground with the airplane between about 35 and 40 mph. The pilot applied right rudder and changed the engine power but was unable to gain control of the airplane. The airplane veered left off the runway, went up an incline, struck the airport perimeter fence, and impacted terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings. A quartering tailwind prevailed at the time of the accident.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a high-speed taxi with a quartering tailwind, which resulted in a runway excursion and impact with a fence and terrain.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=101194](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=101194)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=101194).
