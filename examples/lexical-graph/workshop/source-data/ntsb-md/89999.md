# Aviation Investigation Final Report

## Location:
Minneapolis, Minnesota

## Date & Time: 
August 31, 2014, 14:00 Local

## Aircraft:
EVEKTOR-AEROTECHNIK AS SPORTSTAR

## Defining Event:
Abnormal runway contact

## Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal

## Accident Number:
CEN14CA470

## Registration:
N821EV

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Injuries:
1 None

## Analysis
The pilot maneuvered the airplane to land on runway 12 at the destination airport. Wind was from 190 degrees at 11 knots gusting to 18 knots. The estimated crosswind component was between 10.5 to 17.5 knots. The pilot crabbed the airplane on a 1-2 mile straight-in approach for the runway. Prior to landing, the pilot aligned the nose of the airplane with the runway centerline and reduced power. When the airplane touched down a gust of wind lifted the right wing and lowered the left wing to the runway. As the pilot initiated a go-around the left wing contacted the ground and control of the airplane was lost. The pilot stated that the airplane then stalled and impacted the ground. The pilot reported that his flight school did not fly if the crosswind component was 10 knots or higher and as a result he did not have much experience flying in winds greater than 10 knots of crosswind.

## Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's loss of control while landing with a crosswind. Contributing to the accident was the pilot lack of experience flying in similar weather conditions.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=89999](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=89999)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/aviation.aspx).
