## Accident Number:
WPR14CA256

## Registration:
N681SH

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Analysis

During a solo training flight, the student pilot was maneuvering the helicopter while attempting to land and overshot the landing pad. Before returning to the landing pad, the helicopter began to turn to the right and he applied corrective left pedal input, however the right turn continued and accelerated. The pilot believed either the tailrotor failed or there was a loss of tailrotor effectiveness and lowered the collective. The helicopter touched down still turning with a slight nose up pitch and subsequently rolled over onto the left side. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tailboom and main rotor drive system.

A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while maneuvering for landing.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=89498](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=89498)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/aviation.aspx).
