Piper PA 28-235

## Defining Event:
Low altitude operation/event

## Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Aerial observation

## Accident Number:
CEN14CA160

## Registration:
N9172W

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Injuries:
2 Minor

## Analysis

The pilot had been maneuvering at low altitude below the rim of a canyon in a remote mountainous area and reported that he had done this aerial survey operation in this same canyon several times before. During climb-out from the canyon the airplane failed to achieve enough climb performance to clear the ridge and the airplane impacted terrain at about 8,500 feet mean sea level. The impact resulted in substantial damage to the airplane including the complete separation of the left wing and partial separation of the right wing. The airplane came to rest upright and there was a significant fuel spill, but no postimpact fire. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot also reported that in the future he should maintain a higher altitude for flight over the canyon.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane while maneuvering at low altitude.

## Findings

| Personnel issues | Aircraft control - Pilot |
| --- | --- |
| Aircraft | Climb rate - Not attained/maintained |

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=88925](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=88925)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=88925).
