## Analysis

The pilot reported that, during landing, the gyroplane was too high above the runway. He attempted to "cushion the landing" by forcing the nose up as he "gunned the engine a couple of times." The fluctuations in torque caused the gyroplane to turn right, and he corrected with hard, left rudder application. Because the gyroplane was configured with the front wheel mechanically linked to the rudder for directional control, the front wheel was turned completely left, which resulted in the gyroplane turning "violently" left upon touching down hard and then rolling onto its right side. The gyroplane sustained substantial damage to the main rotor drive system and the empennage. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the gyroplane that would have precluded normal operation and that the accident was caused by pilot error.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's improper landing flare and failure to maintain lateral control, which resulted in a hard landing, loss of directional control, and subsequent roll-over.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100378](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100378)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100378).
