## Analysis

The pilot attempted to perform a full-flap soft-field takeoff in the experimental light sport airplane. The pilot had flown about 16 hours in the accident airplane in the 4 months since he purchased it from the airplane builder; however, this was his first attempt at full-flap soft-field takeoff in this airplane. As the airplane left the ground, it rolled abruptly to the right. The right wing tip struck the ground, and the airplane cartwheeled, coming to rest pointing in the opposite direction of intended travel. The right wing and fuselage were substantially damaged.

Postaccident examination revealed that the airplane's flaperons were misrigged and that the resultant difference in flaperon deflection was more extreme in the full flap position. In the full flap position with a full left control deflection input, the right flaperon moved 3 degrees more and the left flaperon 3 degrees less than they would have if properly rigged. The asymmetric nature of the flaperon deflections induced an adverse yaw to the right despite the pilot's corrective control inputs. Examination of the airplane maintenance logbook revealed that the airplane builder performed the most recent annual airworthiness inspection 4 1/2 months before the accident.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The airplane builder's failure to rig the flight controls correctly, which resulted in a loss of control after takeoff.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=85376](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=85376)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](here).
