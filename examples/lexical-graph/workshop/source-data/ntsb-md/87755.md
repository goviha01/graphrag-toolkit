## Registration:
N159MK

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Analysis

In a statement provided to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the pilot reported that while landing on the narrow runway the wind was prevailing from the left. During the landing roll, the pilot attempted to maneuver the airplane and correct for the wind, but the airplane veered to the right and exited the runway. The airplane continued to the right into a corn field, came to rest upright, and sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar. An FAA Inspector examined the airplane and found no evidence of preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing roll, which resulted in a runway excursion and subsequent impact with a corn field.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=87755](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=87755)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/aviation.aspx).
