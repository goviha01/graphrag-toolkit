## Analysis
While taxiing the rental airplane for departure, the pilot felt the right brake fail, which initiated a left turn. The pilot attempted to correct the turn by applying the right rudder pedal, but the airplane veered onto the grass, pivoted 180 degrees back onto the taxiway surface, and came to rest. Examination of the airplane showed that a portion of the right main landing gear strut had separated, and the right wing was buckled. The strut fracture surface showed discoloration consistent with a preexisting crack. The airplane's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed 5 days before the accident.

## Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:The failure of the right main landing gear strut due to a preexisting crack.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=84917](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=84917)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://here).
