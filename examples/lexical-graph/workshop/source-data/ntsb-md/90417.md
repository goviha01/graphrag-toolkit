## Analysis

The pilot reported that the airplane was operated on a visual flight rules night flight. He estimated that the airplane had about 30 to 32 gallons of fuel prior to departure from the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (BJC), Denver, Colorado, about 1825&nbsp;mst. During the flight, intermittent electrical issues were experienced including static in the headsets, flickering instrument panel lights and a fluctuating ammeter gauge. Attempts were made to alleviate the electrical issues to no avail. A touch and go landing was made at the&nbsp;Kit Carson Airport (ITR), Burlington, Colorado, and a decision was made to shorten the flight and return to the departure airport. The pilot reported that the fuel gauges indicated that the airplane had about 8 gallons remaining in each fuel tank about his time. After 20 minutes had elapsed from the departure from ITR, the fuel gauges showed empty. About 2035 mst, the engine stopped producing power and the pilot switched to the opposite fuel tank. The engine restarted and the flight continued for about 4 to 5 more minutes when the engine again stopped producing power. During the forced landing attempt the airplane struck wires and subsequently impacted the ground. The pilot and the flight instructor stated that the airplane's fuel load prior to departure should have been sufficient for a flight of about&nbsp;3 hours. The total duration of the accident flight was about 2.25 hours.&nbsp;Examination of the airplane subsequent to the accident revealed no fuel remaining in either wing tank. There was no evidence of a fuel spill and no preimpact anomalies were found with respect to the airplane's fuel system. The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented by ordering more fuel prior to departure or obtaining fuel at ITR. Based on the available information, it is likely that the airplane's fuel supply was exhausted resulting in a complete loss of engine power. It is also possible that the observed fuel gauge reading were innacurate given the electrical problems encountered during the flight.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90417](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90417)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90417).
