## Analysis

The flight instructor and student pilot were performing a soft field takeoff from a 2,340 foot grass runway. During the takeoff the airplane did not accelerate as expected. The flight instructor stated that the airplane lifted off, but the trees at the end of the runway were approaching quickly. The instructor then made a slight turn, aiming for some shorter trees to the right. The airplane did not climb out of ground effect and struck a barbed wire fence. The airplane then impacted the ground just beyond the fence and came to a stop in the upright position. Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the airplane's fuselage and wings. A review of the airplane's Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) indicated from grass field, no wind, flaps up, 2000 feet mean sea level, and 88 degree Fahrenheit, the airplane would have a 1,700 foot ground roll and would need 2,827 feet to clear a 50 foot obstacle. The instructor added that the airplane did not perform as the POH indicated. Based on a soft field takeoff technique of having flaps extended and nose high attitude, it's likely the airplane did not reach the grass field performance data indicated in the POH. The soft field, nose high attitude and an over rotation of the nose, to compensate for the rapidly approaching runway end, likely degraded the airplane's takeoff performance.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:The pilot did not obtain adequate airspeed and clearance from obstructions during a grass field takeoff.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=87526](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=87526)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=87526).
