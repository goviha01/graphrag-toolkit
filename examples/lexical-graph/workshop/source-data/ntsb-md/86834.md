## Analysis

The pilot and passenger were returning to the airplane's home airport near the conclusion of a cross-country flight, when the pilot elected to perform a simulated loss of engine power and subsequent practice approach to a farm field. During the approach, the pilot descended the airplane to about the height of the irrigation system installed in the field, when he noticed a "glint of light" and instinctually applied full power, increased pitch, and rolled the airplane right. The airplane then contacted a utility wire, resulting in substantial damage to the right wing. The pilot subsequently returned to the destination airport and landed uneventfully. When enumerating the factors that contributed to the accident, the pilot noted that his "…decision to continue the approach as long as I did also played a role." The pilot also reported that there were no mechanical anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:The pilot's delayed decision to terminate the practice approach during a simulated loss of engine power maneuver, which resulted in an inadvertent collision with utility wires.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86834](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86834)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=86834).
