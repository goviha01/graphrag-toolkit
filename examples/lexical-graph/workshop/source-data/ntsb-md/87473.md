## Analysis

The pilot reported that he and the pilot-rated passenger, departed from the turf runway in calm wind conditions. During the initial climb, the airplane's climb rate was not as expected and he attributed this degraded climb performance to likely being the result of the addition of the passenger's weight. Upon reaching 200 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot began a 180-degree turn to the north in an effort to gain altitude while avoiding maneuvering over obstacles and a more densely populated area.

As the airplane entered the bank, the pilot felt a degradation in performance despite indications that both the engine power and airspeed were adequate. The airplane was not maintaining altitude and in an effort to avoid colliding into a subdivision, the pilot increased the bank angle. The airplane subsequently collided into terrain and came to rest in a ditch adjacent to the airport's perimeter fence. During the accident sequence the airplane sustained damage to the wings and empennage.

The pilot further stated that he believed the airplane's descent during the turn was a result of either of the following: a downdraft, too high angle-of-attack attitude, or possible decrease in engine power output. He reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The passenger opined that the accident was a result of the airspeed being too slow for the steep bank angle.

## Probable Cause and Findings

---

# The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during a turn, which resulted in a loss of lift and collision with terrain.

## Findings

| Element | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| Aircraft | Airspeed - Not attained/maintained |
| Aircraft | Angle of attack - Not attained/maintained |
| Personnel issues | Aircraft control - Pilot |

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=87473](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=87473)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/aviation.aspx).
