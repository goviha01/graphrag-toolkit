## Analysis

Prior to the flight, the doors were removed in order to make it easier for the passengers to board and exit the helicopter. During the safety briefing, the pilot took a headset from a pouch in the rear of the helicopter, demonstrated how to wear the headsets, and then replaced it. The pilot did not tell the passengers that the headsets needed to be replaced in the pouch after landing and before exiting the helicopter. Additionally, the pilot did not make the passengers aware of the danger associated with loose headsets in the back of the helicopter in a doors-off configuration.

After the two passengers were transported to a work site location, the right rear passenger exited the helicopter and placed the headset on the hook located behind the front seats. After departing the site, about 3 to 5 minutes later while en route at an elevation of about 1,000 feet above ground level, the pilot felt something strike the helicopter. After landing and upon inspecting the helicopter, the pilot discovered that the right rear headset was missing and that the leading edge of the tail rotor had been damaged. Upon further inspection of the helicopter, the operator reported that the tail rotor drive shaft was found to be slightly egg shaped at its aft end.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: An unsecured headset, which struck the leading edge of a tail rotor blade. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inadequate safety briefing.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=85842](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=85842)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=85842).
