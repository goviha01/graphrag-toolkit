## Aircraft:
Piper PA 18-150

## Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground

## Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Instructional

## Accident Number:
ANC14CA084

## Registration:
N1879P

## Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

## Injuries:
2 None

## Analysis

The pilot reported he was departing from a remote airstrip in a 3-4 knot left crosswind. After the airplane started its takeoff roll, it drifted left of the planned takeoff path and into low lying brush adjacent to the airstrip. The pilot continued the takeoff roll while correcting to the right with no results. The airplane became airborne, without enough airspeed to maintain flight. The airplane descended downhill and impacted brush and terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's loss of directional control during takeoff from an off-airport site, which resulted in a collision with terrain.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90089](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90089)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90089).
