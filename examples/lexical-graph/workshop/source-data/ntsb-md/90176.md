## Analysis

The pilot reported he landed to the southeast on the 3,700 foot long grass/gravel airstrip and then taxied back to the northwest end of the runway to takeoff. The field elevation of the airport is 7,554 feet. The pilot set the brakes and advanced the engine power to perform a soft/short field takeoff. The airplane lifted off at about 60 – 62 miles per hour and the pilot kept the airplane in ground effect to gain airspeed. The pilot reported the runway sloped down 20 to 25 feet at a point about 1,200 prior to the departure end of the runway. Upon reaching the downslope, the airplane lost lift as if it encountered a downdraft. The pilot reported he overcorrected and the airplane stalled. The left wing contacted the runway, followed by the landing gear and the right wing. The nose gear collapsed which resulted in the airplane coming to a stop. The pilot was able to exit the airplane before it was destroyed by a postimpact fire. The pilot reported there was no mechanical failure or malfunction of the airplane which would have preclude normal operation.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot overcorrected when the airplane experienced a downdraft during the takeoff which resulted in the airplane stalling and impacting the terrain.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90176](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90176)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/aviation.aspx).
