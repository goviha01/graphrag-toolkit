# Aviation Investigation Final Report

## Location:
Columbus, Mississippi

## Accident Number: 
CEN20CA087

## Date & Time:
February 15, 2020, 07:00 Local

## Registration:
N7736T

## Aircraft:
Vans RV8

## Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed

## Defining Event:
Ground collision

## Injuries:
1 None

## Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General aviation - Personal

## Analysis

The pilot reported that he conducted the preflight and that, during the start sequence, the engine's starter would not engage. He turned off the switches, set the parking brake, and exited the cockpit. He rotated the engine by turning the propeller slowly by hand so that the starter would engage. The engine started unexpectedly, and the airplane moved forward. The airplane impacted a hangar and an electrical transformer box, and a postimpact fire ensured, which consumed the airplane and prevented examination of the cockpit, brakes, or electrical system.

## Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The inadvertent engine start of the unoccupied airplane, which resulted in it moving forward and impacting a hangar and an electrical box.

## Investigation Docket:
[https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100953](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100953)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation—railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.

The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, "accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person" (Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 831.4). Assignment of fault or legal liability is not relevant to the NTSB's statutory mission to improve transportation safety by investigating accidents and incidents and issuing safety recommendations. In addition, statutory language prohibits the admission into evidence or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report (Title 49 United States Code section 1154(b)). A factual report that may be admissible under 49 United States Code section 1154(b) is available [here](https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100953).
