## News Report

Amazon today announced the establishment of the Amazon Cybersecurity Excellence Center, a groundbreaking initiative that elevates data protection and security operations to unprecedented levels within the technology industry. The center operates under direct board oversight through Amazon's newly expanded Security Committee, demonstrating the company's commitment to making cybersecurity a core business priority.

The Excellence Center brings together over 2,000 cybersecurity professionals from around the world, including former government security officials, ethical hackers, and AI security researchers. Led by Chief Security Officer Dr. Elena Vasquez, the center operates from secure facilities in Virginia, Dublin, and Singapore, providing 24/7 global threat monitoring and response capabilities.

"Cybersecurity is not just about protecting data – it's about preserving trust in the digital economy," said Dr. Vasquez during the center's inaugural presentation to the Amazon Board of Directors. "Our Excellence Center represents a new paradigm where security considerations are embedded in every business decision, from product development to customer service."

The center's flagship innovation is the "Quantum Shield" system, an AI-powered threat detection platform that can identify and neutralize cyber attacks in milliseconds. The system analyzes over 100 billion security events daily, using machine learning algorithms that continuously evolve to stay ahead of emerging threats. Early deployments have already prevented several sophisticated nation-state attacks that could have compromised millions of customer accounts.

Amazon's board-level security governance includes quarterly security briefings, annual penetration testing reviews, and direct oversight of the company's $5 billion annual cybersecurity investment. The Security Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors with extensive cybersecurity expertise, has the authority to halt any business initiative that poses unacceptable security risks.

The Excellence Center also serves as a training ground for the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, offering advanced certification programs and research partnerships with leading universities. Amazon plans to train 50,000 cybersecurity professionals over the next five years, addressing the industry's critical talent shortage while strengthening global digital security capabilities.
