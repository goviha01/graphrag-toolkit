## News Report

Amazon today launched Skills 2030, the world's largest corporate workforce development program designed to prepare workers for the rapidly evolving digital economy. The $25 billion initiative will provide free training, certification, and job placement services to 10 million workers globally over the next seven years, focusing on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, robotics, and renewable energy.

The program addresses the growing skills gap in technology industries while providing career advancement opportunities for workers whose jobs may be displaced by automation. Skills 2030 operates through a network of 500 training centers worldwide, online learning platforms, and partnerships with universities, community colleges, and vocational schools.

"The future economy will be built on new skills, and we have a responsibility to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in that future," said Dr. Patricia Williams, Amazon's Chief Workforce Development Officer. "Skills 2030 isn't just about training workers – it's about creating pathways to prosperity for millions of families around the world."

The program offers over 200 different certification tracks, ranging from basic digital literacy to advanced specializations in quantum computing and biotechnology. Each track includes hands-on training with industry-standard equipment, mentorship from experienced professionals, and guaranteed job placement assistance upon completion. Amazon has secured partnerships with over 10,000 employers who have committed to hiring program graduates.

Skills 2030's innovative "Learn and Earn" model allows participants to receive paid apprenticeships while completing their training, ensuring that workers can support their families during the transition to new careers. The program provides living stipends, childcare assistance, and transportation support to remove barriers that prevent workers from accessing training opportunities.

The initiative includes specialized programs for underrepresented groups, including women in technology, veterans transitioning to civilian careers, and workers in rural communities. Mobile training units bring education directly to underserved areas, while virtual reality systems provide immersive training experiences that simulate real-world work environments.

Advanced AI tutoring systems personalize the learning experience for each participant, adapting to different learning styles and paces while providing 24/7 support. The system can identify knowledge gaps and provide targeted remediation, ensuring that all participants achieve mastery of essential skills.

The program also includes entrepreneurship training that helps participants start their own businesses, with access to microloans, business mentorship, and Amazon's seller platform for those interested in e-commerce. This component has already helped launch over 5,000 new businesses in pilot markets.

Skills 2030 partners with governments worldwide to align training programs with national economic development goals, ensuring that workforce development contributes to broader prosperity and competitiveness in the global economy.
