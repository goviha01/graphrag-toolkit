Australia reveals the discovery of the world's largest lithium deposit in Western Australia and announces a $15 billion government investment in domestic processing and refining infrastructure to become a global battery materials superpower.

## News Report

The Australian government today announced the discovery of what experts believe is the world's largest lithium deposit, located in the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia, alongside a massive $15 billion investment program to establish the country as the global leader in battery materials processing and refining.

The newly discovered deposit, spanning over 200 square kilometers, contains an estimated 50 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent, potentially doubling global known reserves. Initial geological surveys suggest the deposit could supply global lithium demand for the next 30 years, offering a potential solution to the critical battery material shortages currently constraining renewable energy expansion worldwide.

"This discovery represents a game-changing moment for Australia and the global clean energy transition," announced Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during a press conference in Perth. "We're not just going to export raw materials – we're building a complete domestic supply chain that will make Australia the battery materials superpower of the 21st century."

The government's $15 billion investment package includes construction of six major lithium processing facilities, three battery-grade chemical refineries, and supporting infrastructure including rail lines, ports, and renewable energy systems to power the operations. The initiative is expected to create over 50,000 jobs and position Australia to capture 40% of global lithium processing capacity by 2030.

The announcement has already triggered a surge in global lithium markets, with prices falling 25% on expectations of increased supply. Battery manufacturers and electric vehicle companies have expressed immediate interest in securing long-term supply agreements, while several international mining companies are seeking partnerships to develop the massive deposit.

Environmental groups have cautiously welcomed the announcement, noting the government's commitment to using renewable energy for all processing operations and implementing strict environmental standards. The project includes a $2 billion fund for land rehabilitation and indigenous community partnerships.

The discovery comes at a critical time as global battery material shortages have stalled renewable energy projects worldwide. Industry analysts predict the Australian development could accelerate the clean energy transition by ensuring stable, affordable access to essential battery materials for the next three decades.

Construction of the first processing facility is scheduled to begin in early 2026, with initial production expected by 2028. The government estimates the project will generate over $200 billion in export revenue over the next two decades while establishing Australia as an indispensable partner in the global clean energy supply chain.
