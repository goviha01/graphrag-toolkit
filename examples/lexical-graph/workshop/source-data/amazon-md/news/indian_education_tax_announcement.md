## News Report

The Indian government today announced a 15% education tax on all corporate technology training programs valued over ₹10 million, effective January 2026. The controversial measure, introduced by Finance Minister Rajesh Patel, aims to generate ₹50 billion annually for public education infrastructure but has sparked fierce opposition from technology companies and industry associations.

The tax applies to all corporate training initiatives including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and quantum computing programs. Companies providing free training to external participants will face additional scrutiny, with tax authorities requiring detailed documentation of program costs and participant outcomes. The measure specifically targets large multinational corporations that have expanded their workforce development programs in India over the past five years.

"Private companies have profited enormously from India's skilled workforce, and it's time they contribute fairly to developing the next generation of talent," Minister Patel stated during a press conference in New Delhi. "This tax will fund 10,000 new technical schools and provide scholarships for 2 million students from disadvantaged backgrounds."

Industry leaders have condemned the tax as counterproductive, arguing it will discourage companies from investing in Indian workforce development. The Confederation of Indian Industry estimates the tax could reduce corporate training investments by 40%, potentially affecting millions of workers seeking to upgrade their skills for the digital economy.

The timing of the announcement has raised concerns among international investors, coming just months after several major technology companies announced significant training initiatives in India. Legal challenges are expected, with several industry groups already consulting constitutional lawyers about potential violations of interstate commerce provisions.
