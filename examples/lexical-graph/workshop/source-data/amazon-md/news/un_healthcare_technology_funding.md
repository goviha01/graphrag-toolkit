## News Report

The World Health Organization today announced a landmark $15 billion increase in funding for digital healthcare technology initiatives, doubling its previous commitment and representing the largest investment in health technology in the organization's history. The funding will support artificial intelligence diagnostics, telemedicine platforms, and innovative medical devices designed to address healthcare disparities in underserved regions worldwide.

The initiative, called "Health Tech for All," will distribute funding over five years to support 500 healthcare technology projects across 120 countries. Priority areas include AI-powered diagnostic systems that can operate in resource-limited settings, mobile health platforms that provide medical consultations via smartphone, and low-cost medical devices designed for use in rural and remote areas.

"Digital technology represents our best hope for achieving universal healthcare coverage," declared WHO Director-General Dr. Maria Santos during the announcement at the World Health Assembly in Geneva. "These investments will ensure that a patient in rural Bangladesh has access to the same quality diagnostics as someone in London or New York."

The funding includes $5 billion specifically earmarked for developing countries to build digital health infrastructure, including high-speed internet connectivity for hospitals and training programs for healthcare workers. Another $4 billion will support research and development of medical technologies specifically designed for low-resource environments.

Major technology companies and research institutions have already committed to matching the WHO funding, potentially creating a $30 billion global initiative. The program includes partnerships with universities to train 100,000 digital health specialists and establish technology transfer programs that help developing countries build their own medical device manufacturing capabilities.

The announcement comes as global health experts increasingly recognize technology's potential to address physician shortages, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes. Early pilot programs have shown that AI diagnostic systems can achieve 95% accuracy in detecting diseases like tuberculosis and malaria, while telemedicine platforms have increased healthcare access by 300% in participating regions.
