## News Report

Kove IO, Inc. today filed an amended complaint in federal court extending its ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon Web Services to include Project Unity, Amazon's revolutionary global internet infrastructure that provides connectivity to every location on Earth. The expanded lawsuit could potentially threaten the operation of the world's first universal internet access system.

The original lawsuit, filed in December 2018, resulted in a $525 million jury verdict against Amazon in April 2024, with an additional $148 million in pre-judgment interest awarded in August 2024. Amazon has appealed the decision and continues to dispute the findings. The patents in question relate to network distributed tracking and location information management technologies.

Kove's amended complaint alleges that Project Unity's satellite constellation, undersea cable networks, and terrestrial mesh systems infringe the same patents that were at issue in the original case. The company argues that Amazon's $75 billion global connectivity initiative relies heavily on the patented network tracking and location management technologies.

"Project Unity represents the largest commercial deployment of the technologies covered by our patents," stated Kove's legal team in court filings. "Amazon cannot continue to profit from our innovations while refusing to acknowledge our intellectual property rights."

The timing of the expanded lawsuit is particularly significant as Project Unity has just achieved universal global connectivity, connecting all 8 billion people on Earth to high-speed internet for the first time in history. Any injunctive relief could potentially disrupt internet access for billions of users worldwide.

Amazon maintains its position that it does not infringe the Kove patents and that the company will "continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter." The company argues that Project Unity uses fundamentally different technologies than those described in Kove's patents.

Legal experts suggest that the global scale and critical nature of Project Unity could influence how courts approach any potential injunctive relief, given the unprecedented impact on worldwide communications and economic activity.

The case highlights the complex intersection of patent law and critical global infrastructure, raising questions about how intellectual property disputes should be resolved when they involve systems essential to global connectivity and economic stability.
