#  UK Retailers See Surge in Footfall as Post-Covid Recovery Gains Momentum

February 26th, 2025

In a promising turn of events for the UK retail sector, high street stores and shopping centres across the nation are experiencing a significant uptick in footfall, marking a robust recovery from the challenging years of the Covid-19 pandemic. This resurgence in customer traffic is bringing renewed optimism to retailers who had struggled with lockdowns, restrictions, and changing consumer behaviors during the height of the health crisis.

According to recent data from Springboard, a leading provider of retail intelligence, footfall across all UK retail destinations has increased by 10.4% compared to the same period last year. High streets have seen the most substantial improvement, with a 12.5% increase in foot traffic, while shopping centres and retail parks have also reported healthy gains of 9.2% and 7.8% respectively. This positive trend is being observed across various regions, with city centres in particular benefiting from the return of office workers and tourists.

Retailers attribute this resurgence to several factors, including pent-up demand from consumers who were unable to shop in person during lockdowns, improved consumer confidence as the vaccination program progresses, and a general desire for social interaction after prolonged periods of isolation. Many stores have also adapted their offerings and implemented enhanced safety measures to attract customers back to physical retail spaces. From contactless payment options to improved in-store experiences, retailers are pulling out all the stops to capitalize on this renewed interest in brick-and-mortar shopping.

The increase in footfall is translating into tangible benefits for retailers, with many reporting stronger sales figures and improved financial performance. Major high street chains such as John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, and Next have all reported better-than-expected results in recent quarters, citing the return of in-store shoppers as a key driver. This positive momentum is also having a ripple effect on the wider economy, supporting job creation in the retail sector and boosting confidence among investors and business owners.

However, industry experts caution that while the current trend is encouraging, retailers must continue to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and the ongoing challenges posed by e-commerce competition. The rise of hybrid shopping behaviors, where customers research online but purchase in-store, underscores the need for retailers to maintain a strong omnichannel presence. As the UK retail landscape continues to evolve in the post-Covid era, those businesses that can successfully blend the convenience of online shopping with the unique experiences offered by physical stores are likely to emerge as the biggest winners in this retail renaissance.
