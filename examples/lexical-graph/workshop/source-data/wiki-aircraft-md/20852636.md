The Maule M-7 is a family of single-engine light aircraft that has been manufactured in the United States since the mid-1980s.


## Design and development
Based on the Maule M-4, it is a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane of conventional configuration, available with tailwheel or optional tricycle wheeled undercarriage and frequently used as a floatplane with twin floats. The basic M-7 has a longer cabin than its predecessors the M-5 & M-6, with two seats in front, a bench seat for up to three passengers behind them, and (like the M-6) an optional third row of "kiddie seats" at the rear. Extra cabin windows can be fitted if the "kiddie seats" are to be used. The MX-7 uses the same fuselage as the M-6,which is a modified M-5 fuselage but the same wing span as the M-5, and incorporates the increased fuel tankage, Hoerner-style wingtips and five-position flaps designed for the M-7.
The M-7 family has been produced both with piston and turboprop engines.
