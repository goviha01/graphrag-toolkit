The Cessna 182 Skylane is an American four-seat, single-engined light airplane built by Cessna of Wichita, Kansas. It has the option of adding two child seats in the baggage area.
Introduced in 1956, the 182 has been produced in several variants, including a version with retractable landing gear, and is the second-most popular Cessna model still in production after the 172.


## Development
The Cessna 182 was introduced in 1956 as a tricycle gear variant of the 180. In 1957, the 182A variant was introduced, followed by a deluxe version the following year known as the Skylane. As production continued, later models were improved regularly with features such as a wider fuselage, swept tailfin with rear "omni-vision" window, enlarged baggage compartment, higher gross weights, landing gear changes, etc.  The "restart" aircraft built after 1996 were different in many other details, including a different engine, new seating design, etc. 
By mid-2013, Cessna planned to introduce the next model of the 182T, designated the JT-A, using the 227 hp (169 kW) SMA SR305-230 diesel engine running on Jet-A with a burn rate of 11 US gallons (42 L) per hour at cruise speed of 155 kn (287 km/h; 178 mph). Cessna has no timeline for the JT-A. The normally aspirated, avgas-fueled 182 went out of production in 2012, but came back in 2015.
Cessna 182s were also built in Argentina by DINFIA, as the A182, and in France by Reims Aviation, as the F182.


## Design
The Cessna 182 is an all-metal (mostly aluminum alloy) aircraft, although some parts – such as engine cowling nosebowl and wingtips – are made of fiberglass or thermoplastic material. Its wing has the same planform as the smaller Cessna 172 and the larger 205/206 series; however, some wing details, such as flap and aileron design, are the same as the 172 and are not like the 205/206 components.


### Retractable gear
The retractable gear R182 and TR182 were offered from 1978 to 1986, without and with engine turbocharging, respectively. The model designation nomenclature differs from some other Cessna models with optional retractable gear. For instance, the retractable version of the Cessna 172 was designated as the 172RG and the 177RG, whereas the retractable gear version of the Cessna 182 is the R182. Cessna gave the R182 the marketing name of "Skylane RG".
The R182 and TR182 offer 10-15% improvement in climb and cruise speeds over their fixed-gear counterparts, and similarly, 10-15% better fuel economy at the same speeds at the expense of increased maintenance costs and decreased gear robustness. The 1978 R182 has a sea-level climb rate of 1,140 ft/min (5.8 m/s) and a cruising speed (75% BHP) at 7,500 feet (2,300 m) of 156 kn (289 km/h; 180 mph) TAS at standard temperature.
The landing-gear retraction system in the Skylane RG uses hydraulic actuators powered by an electrically driven pump. The system includes a gear position warning that emits an intermittent tone through the cabin speaker when the gear is in the retracted position and either the throttle is reduced below about 12 inHg (41 kPa) manifold pressure or the flaps are extended beyond 20°. In the event of a hydraulic pump failure, the landing gear may be lowered using a hand pump to pressurize the hydraulic system. The system does not, however, allow the landing gear to be manually retracted.


## Variants
Cessna has historically used model years similar to U.S. auto manufacturers, with sales of new models typically starting a few months prior to the actual calendar year.

The 182S was powered by a fuel-injected 230 hp (172 kW) Lycoming IO-540-AB1A5 and introduced multiple other improvements, such as new seats, cabin soundproofing, and corrosion proofing.  Wheel fairings were no longer standard, though they were still an optional feature along with IFR GPS, and a two-axis autopilot.

Certified on 23 February 2001.  The 182T was the only variant in production as of July 2015.  The T182T was produced from 2001 to 2013, with production forecast to commence again in 2023.


### Special versions
R182 Skylane RG/TR182 Turbo Skylane RG
Introduced for the 1978 model year with retractable landing gear, a 235 hp (175 kW) Lycoming O-540-J3C5D piston engine and a gross weight of 3,100 lb (1,406 kg).  The 1979 model year increased fuel capacity from 75 US gal (280 L) to 88 US gal (330 L).  Certified on 7 July 1977.  The TR182 Turbo Skylane RG was powered by turbocharged 235 hp (175 kW) Lycoming O-540-L3C5D and was certified on 12 September 1978.  At least 2,024 total built; 583 (1978), 729 (1979), 314 (1980), 169 (1981), 129 (1982), 44 (1983), 25 (1984), and 31 (1985), with production continuing into 1986.  Reims also built a total of 69; 21 (1978), 24 (1979), and 24 (1980) as the FR182 in France.
J182T Turbo Skylane JT-A
Powered by a 227 hp (169 kW) SMA SR305-230 diesel engine.  It burns 11 US gallons (42 L) per hour of Jet-A fuel and cruises at 156 kn (289 km/h). The model was first flown in May 2013, and as of July 2015, FAA certification is on hold indefinitely. Originally introduced as the Turbo Skylane NXT, Cessna changed the name to avoid confusion with the Remos NXT.  Only 16 aircraft (one prototype and 15 production) had been built by 2014.  A majority of orders for the Turbo Skylane JT-A had been canceled by 2017, and the aircraft was eventually discontinued.
Robertson STOL 182
An aftermarket 182 STOL conversion certified in 1967 that changes the leading edge shape and aileron controls and lowers the stall speed below 35 mph (56 km/h).
